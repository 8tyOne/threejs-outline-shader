# Three.js 3D Viewer – Outline Shader Showcase

This project is a modular **Three.js viewer** focused on demonstrating a lightweight custom outline rendering shader (`MinimalOutlinePass`).

## Features
- **Custom Outline Shader**  
  Replaces the default `OutlinePass` with a minimal solution that renders clean silhouettes in adjustable color and thickness.  

- **Pixelation Shader**  
  Real-time pixelation effect for a retro 16-bit aesthetic.  

- **Dynamic Lighting**  
  Three adjustable directional lights plus ambient light.  

- **Wireframe Mode**  
  Toggle wireframe rendering for all models.  

- **GUI (lil-gui)**  
  Intuitive controls for outline thickness, outline color, light intensities, pixelation level, and model selection.  

- **Model Loader**  
  Load GLTF models directly via a dropdown menu.  

## Motivation
The goal was to create a **minimal yet performant showcase** for shader effects.  
The focus lies on **clear silhouettes** and a **simple GUI**, making the project well-suited for experimenting with stylized rendering, retro aesthetics, and shader prototyping.
